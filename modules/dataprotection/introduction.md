## Introduction

### Why is data protection important?
In its role as an educational provider, an employer, and a research-intensive organization, the University holds and processes a significant volume of personal data relating to numerous cohorts of individuals. Everybody who processes personal data has a responsibility to do so safely and responsibly. If the University were to lose or otherwise compromise someone's personal data, it could not only have a serious effect on the rights and privacy of the individual but also on the reputation of the University as a safe partner for data sharing and use.

### Why complete the learning?
It is important that everybody remains focused on how we use and protect data. You are required to complete this training within 4 weeks of joining the University and on an annual basis thereafter. If you do not complete the training, your access to the University's systems may be suspended. Completing the learning is a key step in ensuring that the University remains compliant with all data protection legislation, and that we keep our data secure.
