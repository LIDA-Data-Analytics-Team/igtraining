## Seeking consent

About consent

Consent is one of the lawful bases that you can rely on to process personal data. It must be:
- freely given, which means that the individual must not be penalised or have access to a service restricted if they do not provide consent;
- informed, which means that the individual must understand what they are consenting to;
- pro-active, which means that an individual has to take action to provide their consent;
- recorded and;
- as easy to withdraw as it was to provide.
In instances where a person is at risk of very serious harm you can use their personal data without their consent, for example to share it with emergency services.
Ordinarily, when you are collecting personal data for a research project there is a legal and ethical requirement for you to seek the consent of the individual whose data will be included. Sometimes you are able to re-use their data without consent, but you must secure their consent to participate in the first place.
You must also record details if consent is withheld.

## Recording consent

You must keep a record about gaining consent in case you need to provide this as evidence at a later date. Make sure that record is saved in a secure location that your colleagues can also access if they need to.
Remember that you should record this information at the time of the discussion about consent.
You must be able to:
- provide evidence of the consent including whether it was given or withheld and when and how this was done
- confirm exactly what was discussed before consent was provided
- reference the details in a system to ensure that you check regularly whether the data subject has changed their mind
- update the record if anything changes.
We might need consent for some processing which is not covered by the Staff and Student Privacy Notices” to “Consent is just one of the lawful bases we can rely on to process personal data, but it is not always the most appropriate.
Consent does not last forever and should be re-visited, especially if circumstances change. However, there is no set time frame

 for how long consent remains valid, you need to decide when it is time to review consent.
If an individual is at risk of serious harm then you can share their personal data without asking for their consent, for example, if you are making a call to Emergency Services because somebody is injured.

## Key points

Obtaining consent is perhaps not something you do every day.
Remember you can return to this learning and use it as reference to make sure that you comply with data protection legislation.
