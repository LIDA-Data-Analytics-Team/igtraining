## Internet Use

### Risks on the Internet

The internet is a very useful resource but comes with many risks to any organization. It opens the organization's computer network up to a series of untrusted networks where content can be viewed or copied. The internet is unregulated and this means any type of content is available. Illegal software, music and inappropriate images are some of the content that a business has a responsibility to ensure does not get downloaded. This type of content contravenes most organizations' information security policies, and thus companies should do everything they can to prevent such content getting on their network. The internet can be easily misused, resulting in thousands of pounds in lost productivity.

### Accessing the Internet

Access to the internet is provided at work to

 help you to do your job more efficiently and effectively. This can be for a variety of reasons, for example visiting websites for fact-checking purposes, or accessing online systems. However, you must familiarize yourself with the Universityâ€™s IT Acceptable Use Policy to understand your responsibilities. This includes:

- If you misuse University systems and equipment you will be liable to disciplinary action
- If unlawful action is involved you will also risk prosecution

In most organizations, access to the internet is filtered to protect yourself and the organization. Use of the internet is often logged and monitored, so that it is possible to identify sites visited by individual users. Employees aren't typically allowed to download programs or software from the internet. Should you have a genuine business need for additional software you must request this from your IT department. Appropriate licenses and support must also be in place for all software.

### Internet Misuse

Limited private use of the internet will often be allowed if it:

- is done in your own time (for example, during your lunch break)
- does not incur additional expense to the organization
- does not waste time or interfere with normal work
- does not constitute misuse

Some examples of internet misuse might be:

- accessing non-work-related sites when you should be working
- using University consumables (for example, paper and/or discs)
- participating in online gaming during working hours
- private use for commercial gain (for example, eBay).
