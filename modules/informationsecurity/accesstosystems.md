## Access to Systems

### Why Passwords are Important

This component displays an image gallery with accompanying text. Use the next and back navigation controls to work through the narrative. Why are passwords so important? Each user of a University computer system should be issued with their own username and password. The username identifies who you are, the password verifies your identity. All actions on the computer network are logged under the username that performed them. If someone has your password they can pretend to be you; for example, they can send emails and create, modify or delete files. Even sharing a password temporarily can give that person an indication of how you select your passwords, enabling them to guess it in the future. If something is done in your

 name, it will be very hard to prove it wasn't you. Some organisations insist that passwords are changed every 90 days, however the National Cyber Security Centre advise that frequent password changes make it more likely that people will write passwords down, which is poor practice. If your account has been accessed by anyone other than yourself, you must change your password immediately. This change stops someone who has already compromised an account from continuing to gain access. Passwords must be difficult to guess. Never choose one that can be easily guessed by another person. University policy is that passwords must be at least eight characters long, including a number, and should contain mixed case letters to provide better security. Passwords should not be reused, follow an obvious pattern and must be significantly different from previous passwords.

### Choosing a Password

Below is a component which allows you to select hot spots over an image. Select a hot spot to trigger a popup that includes an image with display text. Select the close button to close the popup. Do not just capitalise the first character or add a number to the end. A good password will contain characters from each of the following categories: English uppercase (A-Z); English lowercase (a-z); Base digits (1-10) or characters (!.&.%.£).

#### Some examples

1. Explore using two words separated by a number or a punctuation character, such as: 'Pr0%F0otb@ll' or 'F@5t#F00d'
2. It is more secure to combine three random words into one, rather than to just have one word, such as: 'ParsleyRocketBourbon' or 'FerretChuckleMezzanine'
3. Avoid common substitutes like changing an 'a' for a '4' or an 'i' for a '1'.
4. You can use a combination of insert and replace, for example: ‘stronger’ could be ‘str0nGer’ or ‘str0n&Ger’ or even ‘%tr0n&Ger’
5. Create a password based on a song title, for example, 'Born to be wild' and the password could be 'B2bW1LLd!'
6. Experts agree that longer phrases are safer than a single word, for example, 'This may be one way to remember' and the password could be 'TmB1w2R!'

### Password Selection DON'Ts

When selecting a password, it is advisable not to:

- use your University username in any form (for example, reversed, capitalised, doubled)
- use your first, middle, or last name in any form
- use your initials or any nicknames you may have
- use personal information that can easily be obtained about you, for example pet name, license plate number, the street you live, telephone number etc.
- write the password on sticky notes, calendars, or store it online where it can be accessed by others
- stick any passwords onto laptops, including the security password
- reveal a password to anyone
- store passwords in the Cloud (if you store passwords on your computer), without password protecting or encrypting the document.

## Alternative Authentication

Many organisations including the University now use two-factor authentication alongside passwords, sending a code to a separate device for the user to enter as an extra layer of protection. The University of Leeds uses DUO Multi Factor Authentication. All users of University systems must be enrolled with DUO.

## Social Engineering

### What is Social Engineering?

Social engineering is a method used to get people to divulge confidential information, such as their username and password. In most cases, it can be performed over the phone, text, or email.

### What to Look For

- People asking questions of an unusual or personal nature, or even just asking for your username and password to perform a business function.
- A social engineer that wants to get into a specific network can spend months building a relationship with a person in order to get personal information to log into that network.
- A more common form of social engineering is where you will receive an email asking you to click on a link to update some information. The emails may look like they come from a bank or some such and can look very familiar, however, the link takes you to a fake website which will supply any details that are entered to unauthorized people. This is known as 'phishing’ and is a threat to you at home as well as in work.

### How to Prevent It

- Never give out your username or password to anyone over the phone or by email. If an administrator needs to be able to log on as you, they can use other methods.
- Always be wary of divulging personal information to anyone.
- Always check the validity of websites and emails. If in doubt ask someone to check to ensure they are genuine.
- Never click on links in unsolicited emails without checking out the sender.
- Always verify with a known sender that they have sent you a link.

### Locking Your Computer

University managed computers have an automatic timeout that will lock the computer. To help ensure your user account is not used by anyone else, you must always lock your computer when you are away from it. This is a simple, effective IT security measure you can do yourself. If you leave the computer do not wait for the automatic timeout, you must lock it yourself. The computer must also be closed down properly at the end of each day.

### Remembering Your Password

Which of these tactics should you use to remember your password?

1. Easy, it is my children's names.
2. Write it down on a post-it note.
3. Use a formula to calculate my password so that only I know it.
4. Tell a colleague in case I forget.

The correct answer is 3. Use a simple formula for calculating your password so only you know the correct combination of letters, symbols and numbers. Make sure you don't need to write it down anywhere to remember it.
