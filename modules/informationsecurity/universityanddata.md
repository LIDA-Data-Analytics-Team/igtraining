## The University and Data

The loss of data can cost an organisation thousands of pounds through recovering the data and notifying individuals of personal data loss. Further impact includes the costs of:

- Investigation
- Prosecution
- Loss of trust in the University, and
- Loss of reputation

Some of the types of data that may be held:

- Bank details
- Medical information
- Telephone and internet records
- Intellectual property
- Academic progression
- Home address
- Personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin
- Political opinions
- Religious or philosophical beliefs
- Trade union membership
- Genetic data and biometric data processed for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person

It is important that these kinds of details remain secure, for everyone's benefit.

## Storage Drives and University Data

### Where to Store Information

To access the computer storage areas double click the This PC icon. If it is not a shortcut on the desktop, open the Start Menu to find it. There are usually a variety of file storage drives, as shown by the different icons on the screen. When you save documents, there are specific areas you should and should not use. The Universityâ€™s Information Protection Policy will provide further information, including how to assess and categorise your data. Further guidance as to the storage of data can be found at dataprotection.leeds.ac.uk.

### Why Use University Network Storage?

University network storage is backed up regularly. This means the files stored here are available for use in business areas when needed.

- Should your computer not be working, you can still access files on University network storage from another computer
- Should you accidentally delete a file from the network, it can be recovered from the backup copy if this is essential
- Data that is stored on removable media may not only be insecure, but may not be backed up and could be expensive to recreate if lost

Network storage also allows for consistent access rights to be assigned to files, ensuring that only authorized people can access them. Confidential and personal information should be disposed of in a way that ensures it cannot be read or used when the organization does not require it anymore. This includes paper documents and electronic data. Further information on the disposal of information is available on the data protection website.

## Information Handling

### Risks of Using Removable Media

Removable media can be used to store large amounts of data. However, it is generally small and portable and can be easily lost. Most data on removable media is unprotected and can be accessed by unauthorized people. For more information on the use of memory sticks, CDs and floppy disks see the University's Information Protection Policy.

### Protecting Data

Many organizations have a 'clear desk' requirement whereby all desks must be cleared at the end of each day. However, data must not be left on desks unattended regardless of this. All personal or sensitive data should be locked away when not in use.

### Post-it Notes

Passwords and other items of sensitive information are sometimes written on post-it notes and even taped to the computer screen. Needless to say, you should never do this.

### Unlocked Computers

Never leave your desk with your computer unlocked. This means someone could look at personal and sensitive files and emails, and even send an email as the person logged in.

### USB Stick

You should never leave a USB stick in the USB drive. This could contain personal or sensitive business data.
