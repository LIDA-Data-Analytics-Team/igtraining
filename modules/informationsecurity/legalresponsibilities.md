## Legal Responsibilities

### Relevant Legislation

The use and storing of information by an organisation is controlled by certain Acts of Parliament. There are obligations for the University of Leeds and its employees that need to be followed. Let's look at some key information under some of these Acts.

#### Data Protection Legislation

The UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR) and the Data Protection Act 2018 give rights to individuals about whom personal data is stored (Data Subjects). They may obtain personal data held about themselves, should be told about the use of personal data, and can expect it to be accurate. The legislation places obligations on those who store and use personal data (Data Controllers and Data Processors). They must follow sound and proper practices, known as the Data Protection principles. Principle 6 requires that you have appropriate security measures in place to protect the personal data you hold. The legislation affords individuals a number of rights; any such requests should be forwarded to the University's Information Governance Team.

#### Third Party Data Disclosure

Requests to view personal data must be treated as disclosures to third parties under UK GDPR. To share information with a third party under UK GDPR: there must be a legal grounds for the disclosure; the individual must have been made aware of the potential disclosure in a privacy notice, shown at the time the data was collected; the sharing of the data should be subject to strict security measures to ensure its protection.

#### Companies Act 1985

Adequate precautions should be taken against the falsification of records and to discover any falsification that occurs.

#### Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1998

Software licence compliance requires all software used within the organisation to be legally licensed. If an organisation is using illegal copies of software, the organisation may face not only a civil suit but individual employees may have criminal liability. If liability is proven this could lead to an unlimited fine and up to ten years' imprisonment per offence.

#### Computer Misuse Act 1990

Makes it illegal to gain unauthorised access to a computer. The act is made up of three separate offences: 1. Hacking (unauthorised access to computer facilities) 2. Hacking with intent to commit a further crime 3. Unauthorised amendment, damage or modification of data, including the introduction of computer viruses.

#### Breach of Copyright

Copyright protects material, and the law applies to any medium. This includes literature, art, music, sound recordings, films and broadcasts. This means you must not reproduce copyright protected work in the same or another medium without permission. For example, publishing photographs on the internet, or making a sound recording of a book. Trading standards officers now have a general responsibility for the enforcement of copyright infringement. This gives them the right to make test purchases and to seize goods and documents. In order to effectively enforce copyright law, an organisation must be 100% compliant.

#### Licensing Issues of Free Software

Very little software is free for corporate use. Software companies often grant a licence for their software to be used at home (for non-commercial purposes) but this does not mean it is free to use for work purposes. The corporate market is where software companies make their money. Licences must be checked to see what they can be used for. The activities of a business organisation are obviously considered to be commercial, and therefore software licences must be purchased. Aside from licensing issues, there are the costs of support - both internal and external. This can change the total cost of owning software and the 'cheap' software may in fact turn out to be more expensive.

#### Understanding Legal Responsibilities

Take a moment to think about the reasons why your employer doesnâ€™t allow you to install unlicensed software onto your work computer. This policy helps to ensure that the organisation is obeying relevant licensing and copyright legislation, whilst safeguarding against viruses and other problems.
