## Mobile Computing and Devices

### Mobile Computing Threats

Mobile computing offers new types of threats to corporate networks. It allows people access to the network from outside the protected working environment. Threats include:

- mobile devices being lost or used by unauthorized people
- information on mobile devices being accessed by unauthorized people; whether directly or by reading the screen in a public place

Mobile computing also means that information may be transmitted over an insecure public network.

### Connection of Devices

#### What Can Be Connected to University Wired Network?

The only devices that can be connected to the University wired network are corporately approved devices that have been risk assessed.

#### Why Can't Personal Equipment Be Connected to University Wired Network?

Personal equipment may not be protected to the same extent as University equipment. This means that accessing the Universityâ€™s systems from a personal device could cause the introduction of viruses and other malware, or unauthorized software and files getting onto the network. This could in turn cause damage to the network and files and be extremely costly to recover. Confidential data can also be copied to an insecure device if it is connected to University equipment. This confidential data will not then be subject to the same control and is more likely to be accessed by unauthorized people.
