## Viruses and Other Malware

### What is Malware?

Malware is software that is designed to infiltrate or damage a computer system without the owner's consent; it is made up of the words 'malicious' and 'software'. The most familiar type of malware program is a computer virus. However, there are many other types of malware, for example:

- Adware, which places adverts on computers
- Spyware, which steals personal information
- Trojan horse, which is a harmful program disguised as desirable software

All of them will perform an action on your computer that you have not authorized. Sometimes this will be a malicious action such as deleting files and stealing information and at other times it will be to generate income for someone else.

### How Infections Occur and How to Protect Against Them

Infections can occur by:

- going to an infected website (even Facebook was infected by malware in the past)
- opening email attachments that are infected (although many organizations use virus scanners for email to reduce the risk of this method of infection)
- opening infected files on removable media (for example MP3 players or CDs)

### How You Can Protect Your Computer

- Always check the origin of attachments and removable media, such as USB sticks, before you open them - even those sent by people you know, as they may not know the file is infected.

### What the University Does to Protect Your Computer

- University managed devices and systems have anti-virus software that is updated regularly
- It provides reports and warnings when an infection occurs so immediate action can be taken
- Encryption of mobile devices

In the case of ‘Bring Your Own Device’ (BYOD) you must:

- Update and patch the operating system and applications on your device
- Install anti-virus software on your device and ensure it is up to date. Run a full scan of your device on a regular basis. Microsoft Security Essentials is free to use on Windows devices and can be set to automatically update.

### What to Do If You Think Your Computer Is Infected

- You may not be able to work on your computer as the University's anti-virus software may lock you out.
- Stop working and call Service Desk on 0113 343 3333

### Infecting Your Computer

Which of the following is most likely to infect your computer with a virus?

1. Inserting removable media from an unchecked source.
2. Receiving an email with an attachment, still unopened.
3. Visiting an infected website.

If you answered 1, inserting removable media from an unchecked source, then you were correct. The most likely source of a computer virus is by inserting removable media from an unchecked source. Around 50% of all virus infections come from removable media such as memory sticks that have been plugged into computers without adequate protection.
