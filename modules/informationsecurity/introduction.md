## Introduction

Information resources are vital to the University of Leeds. Their confidentiality, integrity, and availability are essential in maintaining service levels, ensuring legal compliance, and safeguarding the public image and perception of the University. It is important that people are able to trust an organisation to act appropriately, both when obtaining and holding information. It is similarly important that information owned by other organisations made available under legal and legislative requirements is also treated appropriately. Every organisation that uses or provides information resources has a responsibility to maintain and safeguard them, and also to comply with the laws governing the processing and use of information and communications technology. Every organisation must take security very seriously, and that relies on all staff, postgraduate researchers and students playing their part. Everyone is personally responsible for following the requirements set out in the organisation's Information Protection Policy.

### Types of Information

Information comes in many formats:

- Hard copy data, printed or written on paper
- Data stored electronically
- Communications sent by post/courier, or using electronic means
- Stored tape or video
- Speech
- Artefacts - either physical things, such as a historical item, but also items that describe something or a person and should be retained as part of the organisation's record.
