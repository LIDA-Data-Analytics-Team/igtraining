## Information Security Incidents

### What Are Incidents, and Why Report Them?

### What is an Incident?

An information security incident occurs when there is a compromise, potential compromise or unauthorized use of University data or physical assets.

The University incident reporting procedure gives you more details of when and how to report an incident. This can be found on the Secretariat webpages.

### Why Do Incidents Need to Be Reported?

It is a requirement to report all security incidents, so that they can be dealt with quickly and efficiently. Incident reports will also help to identify where future improvements in security can be made.


## The Incident Reporting Procedure

An information security incident occurs when there is a compromise, potential compromise or unauthorized use of University data or physical assets.

### Reporting

It is really important that all actual or suspected data security breaches are reported immediately.

The reporting process is as follows:

- Monday to Friday between 8.00 am and 4.00 pm, on days when the University is open, telephone the IT Service Desk on 0113 343 3333
- When the University is closed or outside the above hours, telephone Estates Security Services on telephone number 0113 343 5494

### Breaching the Information Protection Policy

Breaches of the Information Protection Policy could result in disciplinary action or even prosecution.

### Disciplinary

The University disciplinary process may be invoked for a breach of the Information Protection Policy. The type of action taken will reflect the nature of the breach and could result in dismissal.

### Prosecution

Breaches of the Information Protection Policy could lead to incidents that affect customers, suppliers or a third party.

This could in turn lead to action in the civil courts resulting in fines for the University and/or in some cases, as with copyright breaches, a criminal case and potentially a jail sentence.

Users could also be individually responsible for their actions, for example in copyright breach.

### Other Consequences

The purpose of information security is to protect data, equipment, people and the business.

If any users contravene University policies, then they risk their accreditation with a professional body and their employment prospects.
