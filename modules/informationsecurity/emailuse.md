## Email Use

### Risks of Email

Email is legally treated the same as a company letter; it can be used to form contracts and conduct official business. Emails that contain unsuitable content can result in legal action against the organization. This includes email attachments. Email can be misused - resulting in lost productivity.

### Using Email

Only your assigned University of Leeds email account can be used for the sending and receiving of University-business related emails. You must process your emails within the University managed Outlook application. Email is one of the primary communication channels within the University. All users are expected to check their mailbox box regularly, ensure permissions and rules are reviewed at least annually and data is held in line with retention schedules. Email accounts not used within a period of thirteen months will be lapsed unless IT are informed by the relevant line manager or supervisor of the long-term absence of the user. The use of University email accounts for sending and receiving personal emails should be avoided. University emails must not be used to register for personal service providers such as Amazon or utility suppliers.
