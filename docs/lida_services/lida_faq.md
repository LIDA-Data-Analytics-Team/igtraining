## Do we need to cost the support from LIDA when applying for a grant? 
The costs of using LASER (Leeds Analytics Secure Environment for Research) compute and storage and associated support from the Data Analytics Team (DAT) needs to be factored into your grant. We advise you to approach the DAT directly as early as possible (please allow for at least 7 working days), who will help you to determine what LASER and DAT costs are required for your grant application and how much they will be. 

## Is the support mainly focused on quantitative data analysis (statistical) or both quantitative and qualitative (video-based data)? 
We do support qualitative as well as quantitative/statistical analysis. Our secure environment enables qualitative analysis of audio/video data that would otherwise not have been possible given the IG requirements of the data owner. We can support any analysis that requires LASER’s security controls (including ISO27001 and Data and Security Protection Toolkit).

## Does LASER have its own Data Protection Officer? 
LIDA has its own Information Governance Manager and we work very closely with  UoL IG/IT Assurance and UoL Data Protection Officer Alice Temple.

## What support is there for projects that would benefit from data analytics support but don’t need tier 3 or 4 environment? 
As with project with Tier 3 or 4 data, the DAT can support analysis work within your project and help set up storage space and provide the appropriate secure environment on our Tier 2 platform - SEED. DAT support costs will be dependent on the level of support required. LIDA do provide training courses for common research software such as GIS, R, Python etc. The DAT can provide advice & guidance as to how these are used within your project, regardless of security tier.

## Is Stata available? 
Yes, it is available in LASER. For a full list of available software please see here.
