## Sharing personal information

### Examples of sharing

As data sharing is one of the main reasons for personal data breaches, it’s important that you understand the scope of data sharing.
Sharing data within the University for administrative and business functions is covered by our Staff and Student Privacy Notices.
As long as you have an agreement in place and the research participants understand how their data will be used then you can share data collaboratively with other research partners.
We cannot share data about our students with their parents or family unless the student tells us that it is OK.

### How can I share data safely?

Even when you are sharing data internally it is important to make sure that you do it safely. Generally, it is best to share access to the data (for example via a OneDrive or SharePoint folder) than to send data by email.

If you do have to share data via email be careful to check that you are sending it to the correct person.

Familiarise yourself with the process for reporting an incident where data might have gone to the wrong recipient.

### How can I share data lawfully?

As when collecting data, you need to have a lawful basis for sharing data. Some sharing is already covered in the Staff and Student Privacy Notices which can be found on the University's Data Protection website.

The Notices also cover the sharing of data within the University where it is necessary to fulfill our administrative functions.

We must not share any data about our students with individuals claiming to be their family members of friends without the student's consent. Speak with your line manger if you have any questions or concerns.

### Before you share

Even when you are sharing data within the University it is important to consider the potential implications, especially if you are sharing special category data.

Data sharing as part of a research collaboration is usually explained in the Research Participant Information sheet. There are some exemptions that allow you to share research results without telling participants, but you usually need to anonymise the data first.

Before you share, check the following:
- Check that you have a lawful basis for sharing the data.
- Ensure that the person receiving the information needs to see it.
- Make sure that the information is accurate and up to date.
- Share only that information that is needed.
- Always share the information by a secure means.
- Make a note somewhere prominent that the sharing has taken place, why and with whom.

If the information that has been shared is found to have been inaccurate or if it changes, make sure you tell those you have already shared it with.

### Data Sharing Agreements

These are used when data is being shared outside the University and where the recipient will also be a Data Controller; this means that they can decide themselves how the data will be used (and possibly re-shared with other recipients).

If you are conducting research with an external partner you might need to have a Data Sharing Agreement in place. A template can be found on the University's Data Protection website.

### Data Processing Agreements

These are used when the recipient of the data will be a Data Processor; this means that they can only process the data according to our instructions. A Data Processing Agreement sets out what the Processor can do with the data, how they must store it, any expectations about their use of a third-party processor and when they must return the data. A Processor has some obligations under the law, but the Data Controller (the University) has overall responsibility for ensuring that the data remains safe.

A template can be found on the University's Data Protection website.

You can share data within the University where it is necessary for our administrative functions. You usually need an agreement in place before you can share data with third parties but there are some legal requirements which can override this obligation.

In most circumstances you need to make the individual aware that the sharing is taking place (normally via a privacy notice), although there are some exceptions where the data is being shared with law enforcement agencies or where the person is at risk. Speak with the DPO if you receive such a request.

### Key points

- Remember that accidentally emailing data to the wrong person is one of the major causes of security incidents.
- Make sure that you have an appropriate agreement in place before you share data with an external party.
- Wherever possible, share access to the data rather than sending it as an email attachment
- If you do have to send data in an email double-check that you have keyed in the recipient’s email address correctly.
- If you have sent the data to the incorrect recipient contact the IT Service Desk straightaway.
- If you need to share special category personal data then encrypt any attachments.
- Do not share information with somebody claiming to be a family member or friend of a student without gaining their consent.

## Privacy by design and by default

### What is privacy by design and by default?

**Data privacy by design**

Whilst IT has a role in providing the overarching security of electronic data, we are all responsible for ensuring the security of the data that we work with.

Data privacy by design means having appropriate technical and organisational measures in place and building safeguards into processing to provide data security and protect the rights of data subjects.

**Data privacy by default**

Data privacy by default means having appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure that, by default, only the personal data necessary for the purposes of the processing is processed.

This allows the following data considerations to be controlled:
- the amount of data collected
- the extent of processing
- the retention period of the data
- the access rights to the data.

### New types of processing

The ICO recommend using Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) as an integral part of taking a privacy by design approach.

Data protection impact assessment is a process which helps an organisation to identify and reduce the privacy risks associated with specific data usage. An effective DPIA is a "living document" which is reviewed and amended over time. The University has a template on the Data Protection website.

The core principles of the DPIA process can be integrated with existing project and risk management policies.

There is more detailed information on the Information Commissioner’s Office website (www.ico.org.uk).

### Key points

It's important to know the measures in place to protect personal and sensitive data.

Furthermore, you might want to revisit this section later should you become involved in new projects, or if you think that some existing ways of working with data could be improved.
