## Day to day data protection

### Who is responsible for data protection within the University?
Everyone who accesses information has some responsibility for ensuring that we comply with the legislation and with the University's policies.

**The University:** The University is the data controller. This means that the University is legally responsible for ensuring that its use of personal and sensitive information complies with all aspects of the legislation. This includes a requirement for the University to ensure that all staff who have access to, or handle, personal or sensitive information know how to do so safely and legally.

**Line managers:** Line managers are responsible for ensuring that their staff receive appropriate training and are provided with appropriate equipment to enable them to comply with the legislation.

**All employees:** All employees have a responsibility to comply with the legislation and with University procedures. They can do this by following our data protection policies and procedures and reporting any concerns or data breaches. Employees who deliberately or negligently fail to follow policies and procedures could be subject to disciplinary action. Any misuse of information for personal gain may result in a criminal investigation.

### How does the University ensure compliance with data protection legislation?
Relevant policies and data protection training play a key role in ensuring that the University remains compliant with the legislation. The University's Data Protection website is a good source of information.

The University has key people who have specific responsibilities relating to data protection compliance. In addition to your line manager, these are people who can provide guidance on data protection issues.

**Data Protection Officer:** The Data Protection Officer advises the University about and monitors compliance. The University's Data Protection Office can be reached at dpo@leeds.ac.uk.

**Senior Information Risk Owner:** The Senior Information Risk Owner ensures that the University identifies, addresses, and manages risks to personal and sensitive information. Responsibility is shared between the University Secretary and the Chief Operating Officer.

**Information Asset Owners:** All classified data should have a designated information asset owner. All staff members are responsible for complying with data protection policies.

**Information Governance Team:** The University's Information Governance Team addresses day-to-day compliance with legislation and University policies, including responding to requests made in accordance with individuals' rights; managing incidents; providing guidance and advice; maintaining policies and procedures and risk assessments.

### All in a day's work
When working to tight deadlines and under pressure, it’s important that we are constantly vigilant about how we work, particularly in relation to data protection. This involves following some best practice principles when handling hard copy and electronic information.

Policies and procedures also need to be adhered to when working from home. We would expect colleagues to generate less hard copy data when they are away from the office but it is really important that you think carefully about how you are managing and saving electronic data when you are working from home. If you are working on a computer from home you must make sure that it is encrypted (contact IT Service Desk if you are unsure).

Always use Duo multi factor authentication before accessing University systems.
Let's look at how you can make sure you are doing everything possible to minimise the risk of personal data breaches and cybercrime.

## Disposing of personal information

Do you remember Data Protection Principle 5?
Personal information which is in a format that permits identification of data subjects must not be kept for longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it is being processed.

But what is the right way to dispose of personal information?

### Disposal of hard copy information

The University has a legal obligation to keep some data for a specified period of time. Please refer to the retention schedule.
Always dispose of hard copy sensitive information securely. Make sure that you shred confidential documents.

### Disposal of equipment that holds personal data

Always consult IT Service Desk about the disposal of equipment and electronic devices.

### Deleting emails

We hold lots of information in our email folders, but they are not appropriate storage solutions, especially where they contain personal data. Regularly delete the emails that you no longer need and move the messages and attachments that you do need to keep for longer to a secure location, such as a OneDrive folder.

### Computers and devices

We all have a responsibility to protect the electronic information that we process on computers and other devices. The Information Security training module provides more detail on how we can achieve this.

### Think before you click

Be particularly careful when using email as this is one of the main causes of personal data breaches and cybercrime.

### Emailing special category (sensitive) information

Ensure that personal data and sensitive information is only sent to those that need to see it, even within the University.
Try to avoid sending sensitive personal data via email. If you have to, always password protect or encrypt. It is best practice to send the password or key to the recipient via a different medium.
For example, you could ring your colleague and provide the password, or send it in a separate email.

### University email addresses

Only ever use your University email address for sending or receiving University-related business.
Make sure the email came from a trustworthy source before you click on any links within an email.

### Who are you sending it to?

Always double-check the recipient’s email address before you send an email. If you are sending sensitive data then you might want to consider turning off the “auto-fill” function to provide an extra layer of certainty that you are sending the email to the correct person.
Contact the IT Service Desk for more information.

### Suspicious emails

Report any suspicious emails to the IT Service Desk.

## Key points

You should now know where to go for information and who to ask for assistance if you have questions about personal data and your responsibilities.
