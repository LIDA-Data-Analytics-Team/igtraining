##  Data protection basics

### What is data protection?
Let’s start by making sure that we all have a shared understanding of what is meant by data protection and how we define personal data. We will then move on to review the six principles of data protection, consider individuals’ rights, and finally, learn who enforces data protection in the UK.

**Data protection means:**
- that the use of personal and special category (sensitive) information is strictly controlled
- that information is not put at risk of unauthorized or unlawful processing and is protected against accidental loss, destruction, or deletion
- that we must have a lawful basis to process personal data.

**Data protection rules specify:**
- that individuals have rights associated with the information held about them
- that there is a means of enforcing best practice, via the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) if necessary.

### The legislation in brief
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) applies to all countries within the European Economic Area (EEA). The EEA comprises all countries in the EU plus Iceland, Norway, and Liechtenstein. The UK is no longer one of those countries but our domestic Data Protection law (the Data Protection Act 2018) is equal to the GDPR. This means that we can continue to send data to our EEA partners, and they can send it back to us. Where we want to share data with partners and collaborators outside the EEA, we might need to include extra conditions and clauses in our contracts to provide added assurance that their data protection practices are adequate.

### Implications for individuals and organizations
**Rights to control:** The legislation gives individuals more rights to control and check how organizations use their personal information.  
**Fines for breaches:** The legislation means that organizations could face higher fines for breaches in data protection.  
**Security obligations:** Organizations will have even stricter obligations to keep the personal information that they hold safe and secure from loss and theft etc.  
**Evidenced measures:** Organizations need to provide evidence of the measures they take to comply with the GDPR and the DPA 2018.

There is more information and useful resources such as document templates on the University’s data protection website.

### Personal data
The data protection legislation controls the use of personal data. But how do we define ‘personal data'?

**Definition of personal data:**
The data protection legislation describes personal data as such: “Personal data is a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier, or one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural, or social identity of that natural person.”
A simpler definition might be: Personal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.

**The format of personal data:**
The data protection legislation applies to data stored digitally, as a hard copy, or in visual or audio format. Any details that can be used to identify a person or which can be related to an identifiable person are classed as personal data and are covered by the Act.

**Data Subject:** Data Subject is the term used to describe the individual whose personal data is being collected and used.  
**Data Controller:** The Data Controller determines the purposes and means of processing personal data.  
**Data Processor:** Data Processor means any person or organization who processes the data on behalf of the Data Controller.

### Special category data
The data protection legislation classifies some personal data as being particularly sensitive. Special category data refers to any details which could be more detrimental to the individual if the data is misused.

**Special category data is defined as:**
- Trade-union membership
- Sex life and sexual orientation
- Genetic or biometric data
- Racial or ethnic origin
- Health and medical data
- Religious or philosophical beliefs
- Political opinions

Note that the legislation puts additional safeguards in place around the use of what it classes as special category data. Credit references and bank details are not classed as special category data. Sensitive financial data is subject to different safeguards, within financial services regulations.

### Data protection principles
Take a few minutes to review the six principles of the GDPR. These may be familiar to you, as they have formed the core principles of all data protection legislation in the UK. These principles relate to the collection, use, storage, and disposal of personal information and are the foundation of good data protection practice.

**The six principles are:**
- Lawfulness, fairness, and transparency
- Purpose limitation
- Data minimization
- Accuracy
- Storage limitation
- Integrity and confidentiality (security)

Organizations must be able to demonstrate how they comply with these 6 principles.

**Principle 1 - Lawfulness, fairness and transparency:** Personal information must be processed lawfully, fairly, and in a transparent manner. This means that data subjects must be kept informed about how and why their personal data is processed as well as requiring the processing to be lawful.

**Principle 2 - Purpose limitation:** Data must be collected for a specified, explicit, and legitimate purpose. It should not be further processed in a manner that is incompatible with this purpose.

**Principle 3 - Data minimization:** Personal information must be adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which it is being processed. Personal data should never be recorded simply on the basis that it might be useful in the future. There must be a clear link between what the purpose of the processing is and what data is actually processed.

**Principle 4 - Accuracy:** The data must be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date.

**Principle 5 - Storage limitation:** Personal information must not be kept for longer than is necessary.

**Principle 6 - Integrity and confidentiality (security):** The data must be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal information. This includes using appropriate technical or organizational measures to protect against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage.

### What rights do data subjects have?
Data protection legislation gives rights to individuals relating to the personal data that organizations hold about them.

- The right to be told how their data is being used
- The right to gain access to their data
- The right to request corrections to their data
- The right to request deletion of their data
- The

 right to request restrictions on how their data is processed
- In some circumstances, the right to request their data be passed on to other organizations
- The right to object to how their data is used
- The right to query automated decisions made based on their data

### Additional points to consider
The University has a classification system for all the data it processes, which includes commercially sensitive as well as personal data. While this training focuses on personal data it is important to understand the principles for protecting other classified data as well. Refer to the Information Protection Policy for more detail.

## Scenario
Let’s look at an example of an individual who has concerns about how their personal data is being used.

- Kazia is aware that the University holds some sensitive and personal information about her.
- She is alarmed by an article she has read and stories she has heard about a data breach. The article claims that the personal data of hundreds of students has been published online.
- Kazia decides to call the University to question what data it holds on her, and how it is being used.

**Which of the following do you think apply to Kazia? (Tip: Consider the rights that data subjects have.)**
1. The University must supply Kazia with the information that she is requesting
2. Kazia has the right to know how long the information will be kept on file
3. If necessary, Kazia can ask for her personal information to be updated

**How did you answer?** In this scenario, Kazia is the data subject and she has the right to:
1. know what personal information the University has on file about her
2. ask for the information to be updated
3. know how long the information will be retained

The University cannot charge for providing Kazia with this information.
