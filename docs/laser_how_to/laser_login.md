## Prerequisites
You will need:
- Citrix Workspace installed to the machine you are connecting to LASER from. It's a good idea to [update Citrix Workspace](./troubleshoot.html#i-need-to-update-my-version-of-citrix-workspace) to the latest version.
  - **On university managed devices, install Citrix Workspace via Software Centre or Company Portal (especially for Windows 11 devices). If you’re using a laptop from home and [Citrix isn’t in Software Centre](./troubleshoot.html#citrix-workspace-isnt-showing-in-software-centre), connect to the VPN to let Software Centre update. If you can't install via Software Centre, contact DAT for support.**
  - On personal devices you can download and install the latest Citrix Workspace from [here](https://www.citrix.com/en-gb/products/receiver.html)
- Duo two factor authentication enabled.
  - More information on DUO can be found [here](https://it.leeds.ac.uk/it?id=kb_article&sysparm_article=KB0014537).

## Log in to the Storefront
- Navigate to the StoreFront here: [https://laser.leeds.ac.uk/](https://laser.leeds.ac.uk/).
- Sign in using your University of Leeds credentials.
- When prompted, choose an authentication method and accept the login request/enter the passcode.

- You may be asked if Citrix Receiver is installed:
  - Click to detect installation.
  - Allow browser to 'Open Citrix Workspace Launcher'.
  - If not detected but installation is present click 'Already installed'.
- You are now presented with all of the VRE desktops you have access to. Each icon represents a different virtual machine, and one VRE can have many.
- Click on the image of the monitor or expand the options and click 'Open' to connect.<br>
**Note that any failed attempt to open the chosen virtual machine will still cause it to start running in Azure and therefore incur costs. [Virtual machines can be stopped without logging in](./az_portal/portal_vms.html), via the Azure Portal, if needed.**<br>

  - You may be asked to download a *.ica launcher file.  
  ![Thumbnail image of the Citrix laucher file](../../images/laser_login/citrix_launch_file.png)
  - Save and open this file, it will be deleted when your session ends.
  - Configuring your browser to automatically open this file type will ensure a more seamless experience next time you connect. Example from Chrome browser below:
  ![Cropped screenshot of the upper right corner of Chrome browser, showing recently downloaded ica file and contextual menu with 'Always open files of this type' selected](../../images/laser_login/always_open_files_of_this_type.png)
- Citrix Workspace will launch and connect to your chosen virtual machine
- You will  need to acknowledge the University of Leeds Legal Notice to continue. 
	- Failure to do so within 3 minutes will automatically disconnect the session, leaving the virtual machine running and incurring costs.
	- If this happens you can simply attempt to reopen the same virtual machine. It should open much more quickly as it is now in a 'Running' state.

- On clicking OK to the Legal Notice you will be presented with tour VRE desktop.
