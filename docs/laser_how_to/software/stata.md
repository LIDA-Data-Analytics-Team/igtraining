# Using Stata in LASER

Stata can be installed from [Software Centre](index.html).

Additional packages can't be installed, e.g. via `ssc`, because there is no internet connection as part of [LASER's security controls](../../laser_info/laser.html).

An offline library of Stata packages is kept in LASER so you can use packages despite having no internet connection. To use packages from this library, add it to your adopath every time you open Stata:<br>
`adopath + "R:\Stata\ado\plus\"`

If a package you need hasn't been added to the library yet, email the [Data Analytics Team](mailto:dat@leeds.ac.uk) to request the package, including the URL to the package's website.
