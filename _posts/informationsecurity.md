## Introduction

Information resources are vital to the University of Leeds. Their confidentiality, integrity, and availability are essential in maintaining service levels, ensuring legal compliance, and safeguarding the public image and perception of the University. It is important that people are able to trust an organisation to act appropriately, both when obtaining and holding information. It is similarly important that information owned by other organisations made available under legal and legislative requirements is also treated appropriately. Every organisation that uses or provides information resources has a responsibility to maintain and safeguard them, and also to comply with the laws governing the processing and use of information and communications technology. Every organisation must take security very seriously, and that relies on all staff, postgraduate researchers and students playing their part. Everyone is personally responsible for following the requirements set out in the organisation's Information Protection Policy.

### Types of Information

Information comes in many formats:

- Hard copy data, printed or written on paper
- Data stored electronically
- Communications sent by post/courier, or using electronic means
- Stored tape or video
- Speech
- Artefacts - either physical things, such as a historical item, but also items that describe something or a person and should be retained as part of the organisation's record.

## Information Security

Information security, by definition, is the protection from a loss of three things:

- Confidentiality - So that information remains accessible only to authorised individuals.
- Integrity - So that the accuracy and completeness of information and processing methods are safeguarded.
- Availability - So that authorised users have access to relevant information when required.

### Why is Information Important?

Information is the lifeblood of any organisation, and without information of any sort the institution would cease to exist. It is essential that information is protected in order for the organisation to carry on performing its function. The Information Protection Policy is the document that specifies how the University of Leeds will apply information security. It outlines what risk level is accepted and the responsibilities of staff and every person or organisation covered by the policy.

## Legal Responsibilities

### Relevant Legislation

The use and storing of information by an organisation is controlled by certain Acts of Parliament. There are obligations for the University of Leeds and its employees that need to be followed. Let's look at some key information under some of these Acts.

#### Data Protection Legislation

The UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR) and the Data Protection Act 2018 give rights to individuals about whom personal data is stored (Data Subjects). They may obtain personal data held about themselves, should be told about the use of personal data, and can expect it to be accurate. The legislation places obligations on those who store and use personal data (Data Controllers and Data Processors). They must follow sound and proper practices, known as the Data Protection principles. Principle 6 requires that you have appropriate security measures in place to protect the personal data you hold. The legislation affords individuals a number of rights; any such requests should be forwarded to the University's Information Governance Team.

#### Third Party Data Disclosure

Requests to view personal data must be treated as disclosures to third parties under UK GDPR. To share information with a third party under UK GDPR: there must be a legal grounds for the disclosure; the individual must have been made aware of the potential disclosure in a privacy notice, shown at the time the data was collected; the sharing of the data should be subject to strict security measures to ensure its protection.

#### Companies Act 1985

Adequate precautions should be taken against the falsification of records and to discover any falsification that occurs.

#### Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1998

Software licence compliance requires all software used within the organisation to be legally licensed. If an organisation is using illegal copies of software, the organisation may face not only a civil suit but individual employees may have criminal liability. If liability is proven this could lead to an unlimited fine and up to ten years' imprisonment per offence.

#### Computer Misuse Act 1990

Makes it illegal to gain unauthorised access to a computer. The act is made up of three separate offences: 1. Hacking (unauthorised access to computer facilities) 2. Hacking with intent to commit a further crime 3. Unauthorised amendment, damage or modification of data, including the introduction of computer viruses.

#### Breach of Copyright

Copyright protects material, and the law applies to any medium. This includes literature, art, music, sound recordings, films and broadcasts. This means you must not reproduce copyright protected work in the same or another medium without permission. For example, publishing photographs on the internet, or making a sound recording of a book. Trading standards officers now have a general responsibility for the enforcement of copyright infringement. This gives them the right to make test purchases and to seize goods and documents. In order to effectively enforce copyright law, an organisation must be 100% compliant.

#### Licensing Issues of Free Software

Very little software is free for corporate use. Software companies often grant a licence for their software to be used at home (for non-commercial purposes) but this does not mean it is free to use for work purposes. The corporate market is where software companies make their money. Licences must be checked to see what they can be used for. The activities of a business organisation are obviously considered to be commercial, and therefore software licences must be purchased. Aside from licensing issues, there are the costs of support - both internal and external. This can change the total cost of owning software and the 'cheap' software may in fact turn out to be more expensive.

#### Understanding Legal Responsibilities

Take a moment to think about the reasons why your employer doesn’t allow you to install unlicensed software onto your work computer. This policy helps to ensure that the organisation is obeying relevant licensing and copyright legislation, whilst safeguarding against viruses and other problems.

## Access to Systems

### Why Passwords are Important

This component displays an image gallery with accompanying text. Use the next and back navigation controls to work through the narrative. Why are passwords so important? Each user of a University computer system should be issued with their own username and password. The username identifies who you are, the password verifies your identity. All actions on the computer network are logged under the username that performed them. If someone has your password they can pretend to be you; for example, they can send emails and create, modify or delete files. Even sharing a password temporarily can give that person an indication of how you select your passwords, enabling them to guess it in the future. If something is done in your

 name, it will be very hard to prove it wasn't you. Some organisations insist that passwords are changed every 90 days, however the National Cyber Security Centre advise that frequent password changes make it more likely that people will write passwords down, which is poor practice. If your account has been accessed by anyone other than yourself, you must change your password immediately. This change stops someone who has already compromised an account from continuing to gain access. Passwords must be difficult to guess. Never choose one that can be easily guessed by another person. University policy is that passwords must be at least eight characters long, including a number, and should contain mixed case letters to provide better security. Passwords should not be reused, follow an obvious pattern and must be significantly different from previous passwords.

### Choosing a Password

Below is a component which allows you to select hot spots over an image. Select a hot spot to trigger a popup that includes an image with display text. Select the close button to close the popup. Do not just capitalise the first character or add a number to the end. A good password will contain characters from each of the following categories: English uppercase (A-Z); English lowercase (a-z); Base digits (1-10) or characters (!.&.%.£).

#### Some examples

1. Explore using two words separated by a number or a punctuation character, such as: 'Pr0%F0otb@ll' or 'F@5t#F00d'
2. It is more secure to combine three random words into one, rather than to just have one word, such as: 'ParsleyRocketBourbon' or 'FerretChuckleMezzanine'
3. Avoid common substitutes like changing an 'a' for a '4' or an 'i' for a '1'.
4. You can use a combination of insert and replace, for example: ‘stronger’ could be ‘str0nGer’ or ‘str0n&Ger’ or even ‘%tr0n&Ger’
5. Create a password based on a song title, for example, 'Born to be wild' and the password could be 'B2bW1LLd!'
6. Experts agree that longer phrases are safer than a single word, for example, 'This may be one way to remember' and the password could be 'TmB1w2R!'

### Password Selection DON'Ts

When selecting a password, it is advisable not to:

- use your University username in any form (for example, reversed, capitalised, doubled)
- use your first, middle, or last name in any form
- use your initials or any nicknames you may have
- use personal information that can easily be obtained about you, for example pet name, license plate number, the street you live, telephone number etc.
- write the password on sticky notes, calendars, or store it online where it can be accessed by others
- stick any passwords onto laptops, including the security password
- reveal a password to anyone
- store passwords in the Cloud (if you store passwords on your computer), without password protecting or encrypting the document.

## Alternative Authentication

Many organisations including the University now use two-factor authentication alongside passwords, sending a code to a separate device for the user to enter as an extra layer of protection. The University of Leeds uses DUO Multi Factor Authentication. All users of University systems must be enrolled with DUO.

## Social Engineering

### What is Social Engineering?

Social engineering is a method used to get people to divulge confidential information, such as their username and password. In most cases, it can be performed over the phone, text, or email.

### What to Look For

- People asking questions of an unusual or personal nature, or even just asking for your username and password to perform a business function.
- A social engineer that wants to get into a specific network can spend months building a relationship with a person in order to get personal information to log into that network.
- A more common form of social engineering is where you will receive an email asking you to click on a link to update some information. The emails may look like they come from a bank or some such and can look very familiar, however, the link takes you to a fake website which will supply any details that are entered to unauthorized people. This is known as 'phishing’ and is a threat to you at home as well as in work.

### How to Prevent It

- Never give out your username or password to anyone over the phone or by email. If an administrator needs to be able to log on as you, they can use other methods.
- Always be wary of divulging personal information to anyone.
- Always check the validity of websites and emails. If in doubt ask someone to check to ensure they are genuine.
- Never click on links in unsolicited emails without checking out the sender.
- Always verify with a known sender that they have sent you a link.

### Locking Your Computer

University managed computers have an automatic timeout that will lock the computer. To help ensure your user account is not used by anyone else, you must always lock your computer when you are away from it. This is a simple, effective IT security measure you can do yourself. If you leave the computer do not wait for the automatic timeout, you must lock it yourself. The computer must also be closed down properly at the end of each day.

### Choosing a Password

Have a look at the passwords below and decide whether each is an example of a good or bad password.

- ArcticOregonHilt
- Monday2
- M1cwb@Dho19/3
- Pro%F0otball
- Qwertyuiop

From the list, the following adhere to the recommendations for selecting a secure password:

- ArcticOregonHilt
- M1cwb@Dho19/3
- Pro%F0otball

If you are unsure about selecting a secure password, read this section again.

### Remembering Your Password

Which of these tactics should you use to remember your password?

1. Easy, it is my children's names.
2. Write it down on a post-it note.
3. Use a formula to calculate my password so that only I know it.
4. Tell a colleague in case I forget.

The correct answer is 3. Use a simple formula for calculating your password so only you know the correct combination of letters, symbols and numbers. Make sure you don't need to write it down anywhere to remember it.

## The University and Data

The loss of data can cost an organisation thousands of pounds through recovering the data and notifying individuals of personal data loss. Further impact includes the costs of:

- Investigation
- Prosecution
- Loss of trust in the University, and
- Loss of reputation

Some of the types of data that may be held:

- Bank details
- Medical information
- Telephone and internet records
- Intellectual property
- Academic progression
- Home address
- Personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin
- Political opinions
- Religious or philosophical beliefs
- Trade union membership
- Genetic data and biometric data processed for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person

It is important that these kinds of details remain secure, for everyone's benefit.

## Storage Drives and University Data

### Where to Store Information

To access the computer storage areas double click the This PC icon. If it is not a shortcut on the desktop, open the Start Menu to find it. There are usually a variety of file storage drives, as shown by the different icons on the screen. When you save documents, there are specific areas you should and should not use. The University’s Information Protection Policy will provide further information, including how to assess and categorise your data. Further guidance as to the storage of data can be found at dataprotection.leeds.ac.uk.

### Why Use University Network Storage?

University network storage is backed up regularly. This means the files stored here are available for use in business areas when needed.

- Should your computer not be working, you can still access files on University network storage from another computer
- Should you accidentally delete a file from the network, it can be recovered from the backup copy if this is essential
- Data that is stored on removable media may not only be insecure, but may not be backed up and could be expensive to recreate if lost

Network storage also allows for consistent access rights to be assigned to files, ensuring that only authorized people can access them. Confidential and personal information should be disposed of in a way that ensures it cannot be read or used when the organization does not require it anymore. This includes paper documents and electronic data. Further information on the disposal of information is available on the data protection website.

## Information Handling

### Risks of Using Removable Media

Removable media can be used to store large amounts of data. However, it is generally small and portable and can be easily lost. Most data on removable media is unprotected and can be accessed by unauthorized people. For more information on the use of memory sticks, CDs and floppy disks see the University's Information Protection Policy.

### Protecting Data

Many organizations have a 'clear desk' requirement whereby all desks must be cleared at the end of each day. However, data must not be left on desks unattended regardless of this. All personal or sensitive data should be locked away when not in use.

### Post-it Notes

Passwords and other items of sensitive information are sometimes written on post-it notes and even taped to the computer screen. Needless to say, you should never do this.

### Unlocked Computers

Never leave your desk with your computer unlocked. This means someone could look at personal and sensitive files and emails, and even send an email as the person logged in.

### USB Stick

You should never leave a USB stick in the USB drive. This could contain personal or sensitive business data.

## Internet Use

### Risks on the Internet

The internet is a very useful resource but comes with many risks to any organization. It opens the organization's computer network up to a series of untrusted networks where content can be viewed or copied. The internet is unregulated and this means any type of content is available. Illegal software, music and inappropriate images are some of the content that a business has a responsibility to ensure does not get downloaded. This type of content contravenes most organizations' information security policies, and thus companies should do everything they can to prevent such content getting on their network. The internet can be easily misused, resulting in thousands of pounds in lost productivity.

### Accessing the Internet

Access to the internet is provided at work to

 help you to do your job more efficiently and effectively. This can be for a variety of reasons, for example visiting websites for fact-checking purposes, or accessing online systems. However, you must familiarize yourself with the University’s IT Acceptable Use Policy to understand your responsibilities. This includes:

- If you misuse University systems and equipment you will be liable to disciplinary action
- If unlawful action is involved you will also risk prosecution

In most organizations, access to the internet is filtered to protect yourself and the organization. Use of the internet is often logged and monitored, so that it is possible to identify sites visited by individual users. Employees aren't typically allowed to download programs or software from the internet. Should you have a genuine business need for additional software you must request this from your IT department. Appropriate licenses and support must also be in place for all software.

### Internet Misuse

Limited private use of the internet will often be allowed if it:

- is done in your own time (for example, during your lunch break)
- does not incur additional expense to the organization
- does not waste time or interfere with normal work
- does not constitute misuse

Some examples of internet misuse might be:

- accessing non-work-related sites when you should be working
- using University consumables (for example, paper and/or discs)
- participating in online gaming during working hours
- private use for commercial gain (for example, eBay).

## Email Use

### Risks of Email

Email is legally treated the same as a company letter; it can be used to form contracts and conduct official business. Emails that contain unsuitable content can result in legal action against the organization. This includes email attachments. Email can be misused - resulting in lost productivity.

### Using Email

Only your assigned University of Leeds email account can be used for the sending and receiving of University-business related emails. You must process your emails within the University managed Outlook application. Email is one of the primary communication channels within the University. All users are expected to check their mailbox box regularly, ensure permissions and rules are reviewed at least annually and data is held in line with retention schedules. Email accounts not used within a period of thirteen months will be lapsed unless IT are informed by the relevant line manager or supervisor of the long-term absence of the user. The use of University email accounts for sending and receiving personal emails should be avoided. University emails must not be used to register for personal service providers such as Amazon or utility suppliers.

## Viruses and Other Malware

### What is Malware?

Malware is software that is designed to infiltrate or damage a computer system without the owner's consent; it is made up of the words 'malicious' and 'software'. The most familiar type of malware program is a computer virus. However, there are many other types of malware, for example:

- Adware, which places adverts on computers
- Spyware, which steals personal information
- Trojan horse, which is a harmful program disguised as desirable software

All of them will perform an action on your computer that you have not authorized. Sometimes this will be a malicious action such as deleting files and stealing information and at other times it will be to generate income for someone else.

### How Infections Occur and How to Protect Against Them

Infections can occur by:

- going to an infected website (even Facebook was infected by malware in the past)
- opening email attachments that are infected (although many organizations use virus scanners for email to reduce the risk of this method of infection)
- opening infected files on removable media (for example MP3 players or CDs)

### How You Can Protect Your Computer

- Always check the origin of attachments and removable media, such as USB sticks, before you open them - even those sent by people you know, as they may not know the file is infected.

### What the University Does to Protect Your Computer

- University managed devices and systems have anti-virus software that is updated regularly
- It provides reports and warnings when an infection occurs so immediate action can be taken
- Encryption of mobile devices

In the case of ‘Bring Your Own Device’ (BYOD) you must:

- Update and patch the operating system and applications on your device
- Install anti-virus software on your device and ensure it is up to date. Run a full scan of your device on a regular basis. Microsoft Security Essentials is free to use on Windows devices and can be set to automatically update.

### What to Do If You Think Your Computer Is Infected

- You may not be able to work on your computer as the University's anti-virus software may lock you out.
- Stop working and call Service Desk on 0113 343 3333

### Infecting Your Computer

Which of the following is most likely to infect your computer with a virus?

1. Inserting removable media from an unchecked source.
2. Receiving an email with an attachment, still unopened.
3. Visiting an infected website.

If you answered 1, inserting removable media from an unchecked source, then you were correct. The most likely source of a computer virus is by inserting removable media from an unchecked source. Around 50% of all virus infections come from removable media such as memory sticks that have been plugged into computers without adequate protection.

## Mobile Computing and Devices

### Mobile Computing Threats

Mobile computing offers new types of threats to corporate networks. It allows people access to the network from outside the protected working environment. Threats include:

- mobile devices being lost or used by unauthorized people
- information on mobile devices being accessed by unauthorized people; whether directly or by reading the screen in a public place

Mobile computing also means that information may be transmitted over an insecure public network.

### Connection of Devices

#### What Can Be Connected to University Wired Network?

The only devices that can be connected to the University wired network are corporately approved devices that have been risk assessed.

#### Why Can't Personal Equipment Be Connected to University Wired Network?

Personal equipment may not be protected to the same extent as University equipment. This means that accessing the University’s systems from a personal device could cause the introduction of viruses and other malware, or unauthorized software and files getting onto the network. This could in turn cause damage to the network and files and be extremely costly to recover. Confidential data can also be copied to an insecure device if it is connected to University equipment. This confidential data will not then be subject to the same control and is more likely to be accessed by unauthorized people.

## Information Security Incidents

### What Are Incidents, and Why Report Them?

### What is an Incident?

An information security incident occurs when there is a compromise, potential compromise or unauthorized use of University data or physical assets.

The University incident reporting procedure gives you more details of when and how to report an incident. This can be found on the Secretariat webpages.

### Why Do Incidents Need to Be Reported?

It is a requirement to report all security incidents, so that they can be dealt with quickly and efficiently. Incident reports will also help to identify where future improvements in security can be made.


## The Incident Reporting Procedure

An information security incident occurs when there is a compromise, potential compromise or unauthorized use of University data or physical assets.

### Reporting

It is really important that all actual or suspected data security breaches are reported immediately.

The reporting process is as follows:

- Monday to Friday between 8.00 am and 4.00 pm, on days when the University is open, telephone the IT Service Desk on 0113 343 3333
- When the University is closed or outside the above hours, telephone Estates Security Services on telephone number 0113 343 5494

### Breaching the Information Protection Policy

Breaches of the Information Protection Policy could result in disciplinary action or even prosecution.

### Disciplinary

The University disciplinary process may be invoked for a breach of the Information Protection Policy. The type of action taken will reflect the nature of the breach and could result in dismissal.

### Prosecution

Breaches of the Information Protection Policy could lead to incidents that affect customers, suppliers or a third party.

This could in turn lead to action in the civil courts resulting in fines for the University and/or in some cases, as with copyright breaches, a criminal case and potentially a jail sentence.

Users could also be individually responsible for their actions, for example in copyright breach.

### Other Consequences

The purpose of information security is to protect data, equipment, people and the business.

If any users contravene University policies, then they risk their accreditation with a professional body and their employment prospects.
