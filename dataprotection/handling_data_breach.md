## What to do if there is a personal data breach

Your thoughts

Meet Steve. His role means that he has access to a lot of personal and sensitive data.
• Steve is early for a meeting, so he logs on to his laptop and catches up with some emails.
• Steve’s rushing to finish and send a message so that he can get a coffee to take to the meeting.
• Steve suddenly realises that he has selected the wrong email address.
• Even worse, he has sent this special category data to a group email which includes people from other organisations.

Do you think that Steve needs to report this as a personal data breach?

If you answered ‘yes’, well done.

A personal data breach occurs if any personal and sensitive information is:
• seen, accessed by or overheard by anyone who doesn’t need to know about it
• held on any equipment or in hard copy that is lost or mislaid, even if it is encrypted.
• accidentally or unlawfully destroyed or altered.

## Breaching incidents

Let's look at some example of data security breach incidents.

### Device loss

Losing a portable device that stores personal data, including USB sticks and work phones, tablets or laptops.

### Data theft

As well as the more commonly discussed cyber-attacks deployed to steal data, data theft can also include any data stolen by an employee or contractor.

### Malware

Malware is unauthorised software that is designed to infiltrate or damage a computer system without the owner's consent.
The most familiar type of malware program is a computer virus – for example, a Trojan virus which is designed to delete files and steal or corrupt information and personal data.

### Compliance

Compliance means following the policies, procedures, rules and guidelines established within an organisation.
Data compliance requires that all personal data be organised and managed in line with the law and the University's regulations. An example of a data compliance breach would be sharing data outside of the terms agreed in a data sharing agreement.

### Errors

Data breaches often occur from simple human errors, such as sending an email to the wrong recipient or failing to complete a mail merge and mismatching names and addresses. This highlights the importance of carefully handling information and double-checking any of your work that incorporates data, personal or otherwise.

### Loss of access to critical records

This will often involve situations that are out of an individual's control – for example, a systems disruption that means data subjects can't receive the vital service that they require, or even a flood which damages records that are not backed up. Organisations with healthy data protection protocols should have preventative and/or recovery measures in place for losing data in this way.

## Personal data breaches

What percentage of personal data breaches do you think are due to human error?

According to a CybSafe analysis of data from the UK Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), human error caused 90% of cyber data breaches in 2019, up from 61% in 2017 and 87% in 2018.

## Reporting the breach

It is very important to act quickly if you become aware of a personal data breach – all actual or suspected data security breaches must be reported immediately. This allows the University to take necessary steps to prevent a breach or to minimise the potential impact of one.

If you think that you have sent electronic data to the wrong recipient then you must telephone the IT Service Desk on 0113 34 33333 - if you do this quickly then they may be able to retrieve the data before it is accessed by the wrong person.
You should then contact the DPO (dpo@leeds.ac.uk) and let them know what has happened and what action has been taken. The DPO can then decide what further action, if any, is needed. You must never speak with the individuals affected or the ICO until you have spoken with the DPO or somebody from the Information Governance Team.

If you have lost hard copies of personal data then contact the DPO. If you suspect that your computer has been compromised then contact the IT Service Desk. Contact details for reporting a data security breach can be found on the University Data Protection website.

It is really important that all actual or suspected data security breaches are reported immediately. This allows the University to take necessary

 steps to prevent a breach or to minimise the potential impact of a breach.

Data protection legislation imposes very strict deadlines for reporting serious personal data breaches, which is why you need to report them as soon as you become aware of them.

The University could be fined for late notification as well as for the breach itself.

## What happens next?

### Investigation

An investigation will be carried out by the Data Protection Officer and the IT Assurance Team as required.
The investigation looks at what happened and why, what needs to be done to limit the impact, who needs to be told and what can be done to prevent a similar incident in future. The team involved in the incident will need to consider their own work practices and reflect on whether data is being protected appropriately.
The results of the investigation determine whether it is a serious risk that needs to be referred to the Information Commissioner’s Office.
The Information Governance Team will liaise with the Information Commissioner's Office.

### Information Commissioner's Office

If the incident is deemed to be serious, the University must report the details to the Information Commissioner within 72 hours of the incident being known.

### Data subjects

The law requires that we inform those whose personal information is affected if their rights or privacy could be at risk. You must not inform individuals directly; this will be coordinated by the Information Governance Team.

## True or false?

Indicate whether the following statements about reporting breaches are true or false:
• Incidents involving electronic data must be reported to the IT Service Desk immediately.
• The University must report a serious incident to the Information Commissioner within 72 hours.

The first statement is true. It is essential that data protection incidents involving electronic data are reported to the IT Service Desk immediately.
The second statement is also true. The University must report a serious incident to the Information Commissioner within 72 hours of becoming aware of it. You must never speak with the individuals affected or the Information Commissioner until you have spoken with the Data Protection Officer or somebody from the Information Governance Team.

## Key points

This section has identified the steps that you must take if you become aware of a personal data breach.
Remember that it is essential that you report incidents as early as possible.
