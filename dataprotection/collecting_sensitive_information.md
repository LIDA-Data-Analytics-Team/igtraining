## Collecting personal and special category (sensitive) information

Identifiable or anonymous?

Before collecting data, you should consider whether the personal data needs to be identifiable or if it can be anonymised.

### Identifiable

Identifiable data is data that easily identifies an individual or a group of individuals.

### Anonymised

Anonymised data has had all personal data removed so that an individual or group of individuals cannot be identified.

## What am I allowed to do with personal data?

The University has in place a privacy notice for Staff and a Privacy Notice for Students. These notices cover the types of data processing which have already been authorised and which you can undertake without any further action.
Both documents can be found on the Universityâ€™s Data Protection website.

## What if I want to process other data?

If what you want to do is not already covered in the University's Privacy Notices you will need to advise individuals about the proposed processing. This is best done by creating your own privacy notice which explains what data you want to collect and what you want to do with it.
Seek advice from the Information Governance Team.

## Privacy notices

As well as detailing when personal data can be collected, data protection legislation requires that the collection of personal data is transparent and respects the rights of the individual whose personal data is being collected.
The transparency requirements are met in a privacy notice.
A Privacy Notice explains who is collecting the data; where it is being collected from, what will be done with the data, including how it will be kept safe and who it might be shared with, and when the data will be deleted. It must include a lawful basis for why the data is being used and must also explain the rights of the individual whose data is being collected.

## Lawful basis for processing

In order to comply with the principles of data protection legislation you must always have a lawful basis for processing personal data. This helps you to define why you need the data and what you will do with it.
The lawful bases for processing personal data are:
1. The data subject has provided their consent.
2. The processing is necessary for the performance of a contract (for example, a staff or student contract with the University).
3. The processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation (for example, reporting to the UK Visas and Immigration Office).
4. The processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of a person.
5. The processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest (this is sometimes applicable for research).
6. The processing is necessary for the legitimate interests of the organisation (for example, where the University undertakes outreach work to its Alumni community).
If you want to process special category data you must also identify an additional lawful basis; these include processing for research which is in the public interest and processing where measures have been put in place to protect the rights of the individuals whose data is being used. Speak with the Information Governance Team for more information.

## Summary

This section explores the requirement to let individuals know what data you are collecting about them and what you will do with it; information which is usually made available in a document called a privacy notice.
It is a good idea to familiarise yourself with the Staff and Student Privacy Notices on the University Data Protection website. If you are wanting to gather personal data which is not covered in these notices then contact the Information Governance Team.
